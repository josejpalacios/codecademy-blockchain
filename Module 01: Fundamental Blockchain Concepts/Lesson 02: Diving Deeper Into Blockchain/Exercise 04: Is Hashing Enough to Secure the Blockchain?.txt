Block A with hash X123
Block B with hash Y456
Block C with hash Z789

If Block A hash changes to 123X, then Block B will have a mismatch with previous hash value.
To fix this, the previous hash of Block B has to be changed from X123 to 123X.

Changing the previous hash of Block B will result in Block B's hash changing.
The process will have to be repeated for all the following blocks.

Doing the process will create a valid copy of the blockchain.
