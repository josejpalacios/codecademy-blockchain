Each block has a unique. Tampering with a block results in the unique hash changing.
The following block contains the previous unchanged hash.

Cause of the mismatch between hashing, the link between blocks is broken. This results
in an invalid copy of the blockchain.

This causes the records to be immutable.

Key Terms:
* Hashing: Generating a random string of characters from a given input.
* Immutable: Something whose records canâ€™t be changed.
