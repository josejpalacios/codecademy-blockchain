Mempool: Location that unvalidated transactions get placed. These transactions get broadcasted to all computers in
the blockchain network.

Computers collect these transactions; but have a limited amount they can hold.

When block is full, the next set of transactions wait in the mempool. At this point, block is unconfirmed, and the
transactions in the block are invalidated.

Key Terms:
* Transactions: An exchange of value among participants on the blockchain network.
* Participants: Individuals accessing the blockchain network through computers to exchange value. 
* Unconfirmed: Blocks and transactions that are yet to be verified.
