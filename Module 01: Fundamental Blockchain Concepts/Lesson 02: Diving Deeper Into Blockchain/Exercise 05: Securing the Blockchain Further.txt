Previous exercise details why another layer of security is needed to secure the blockchain from outside interference.

Blockchain uses Proof-of-Work:
* Makes it difficult for participants to modify blocks by re-calculating hashes.
* Relies on bulletproof cryptography instead of anonymous participants to verify transactions.

Key Terms:
* Proof-of-Work: A security feature in blockchain to prevent attackers from easily taking over the blockchain. 
* Trustless: A feature of blockchain that states how the system doesnâ€™t rely on any participant to verify transactions.
