Proof-of-Work introduces an additional layer of security through a difficult time-consuming math problem for a computer.

To broadcast unconfirmed block, miners will need to solve a problem in order to broadcast their block. The problem
is in a form of game involving hashing. Commonly used hash function SHA-256 is used for the problem.

Process for Proof-of-Work:
1. Guess a nonce value.
2. Combine value with contents of block.
3. Repeat until desired hash is generated.
4. First miner to complete problem will broadcast their unconfirmed block with the correct nonce value.
5. The rest of the network will than verify the calculation.
6. If majority agree, the Proof-of-Word for block is completed.
7. Block is now confirm; network moves onto next block.

Key Terms:
* Miners: Special participants who calculate the Proof-of-Work to mine new blocks.
* Nonce: A number to be guessed by miners which when combined with the block produces an acceptable hash.
