Key Terms:
* Blockchain Network: The blockchain network and blockchain are terms used interchangeably.
They represent the entire blockchain from the structure itself to the network that it is a part of.

* Decentralization: The concept in which participants work together to
validate transactions without relying on a central authority.

* Participant: A client that owns a copy of the blockchain and verifies transactions across the network.

In a blockchain:
- There are many participants/computers in the network; each with their own copy of the blockchain.
- Computers validate the blockchain when a block is being added.
- 51% of computers must validate the new block is not fraudulent.
- Once valid, the block gets added to every computer's blockchain.

Having the majority of participants validate a new transaction,
the blockchain removes the need for a central authority and
automates the completion of transactions.
