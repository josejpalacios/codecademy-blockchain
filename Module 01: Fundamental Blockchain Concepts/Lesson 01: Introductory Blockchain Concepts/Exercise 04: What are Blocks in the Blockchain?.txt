Blocks are building blocks of a blockchain.

A block contains:
- Hash: Code produced by combining all information within the block.
- Previous Hash: Reference to previous block.
- Timestamp: Time when block was created; determines location of block on blockchain.
- Transaction Data: Record to be stored in the block.

Reference to previous block is what creates the blockchain and makes the blockchain secure.
