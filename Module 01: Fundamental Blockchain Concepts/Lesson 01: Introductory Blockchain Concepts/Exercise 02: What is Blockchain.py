# The blockchain is similar to a permanent book of records that
# keeps a log of all transactions that have taken place in chronological order.

# The blockchain relies on a public network of computers to verify the transaction.

# The blockchain is just an accurate, and permanent record of all the transactions
# that have happened amongst the members in that blockchainâ€™s network.

# In this analogy, each block in the blockchain represents a transaction,
# and each transaction is connected to the prior transaction to form the entire connected blockchain.
