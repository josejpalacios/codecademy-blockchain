Key Terms:
* Deterministic: The same input will always produce the same output, but that output cannot produce the original input.
* Hash: A calculated string of letters and numbers produced from a specific input.
* Hash Function: A function that takes in an input of a random size, performs hashing on the input, and generates a seemingly random output of a fixed size, also known as the hash.

Blockchain uses a Hash Function to generate a Hash with the Blocks data.
The Hash cannot be used to get the original input.
